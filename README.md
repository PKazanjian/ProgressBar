# progressbar
## Displays the progress of 15 containers starting
If you wish to measure the progress of something else, change these three items:
1. Change the \_f100 variable on line 6 to reflect what 100% should be 
2. Change the command on line 21 (In my case it was used to spin up 15 containers)
3. Change the \_current variable on line 33 to a command to get the current number

# progressbar
## Displays the progress of 15 containers starting
If you wish to measure the progress of something else, change these three items:
1. Change the \_current variable on line 34 to reflect what you are measuring
2. Change the \_f100 variable on line 6 to reflect what 100% should be
3. Change the command on line 22
